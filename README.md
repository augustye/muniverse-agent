# µniverse-agent

This program trains RL agents to play games in [µniverse](https://github.com/unixpickle/muniverse). It uses [A3C](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783) to optimize neural networks policies.

This is intended to be used as a baseline. It gives an idea of how well traditional deep-RL does on µniverse games.
