# Agent scripts

**NOTE:** these scripts are basically small hacks. If you want to run muniverse-agent, I recommend you start by running the code in the root of this repository.

These are small programs used to pre-train an agent. In some games, random actions aren't good enough to get any reward at all. For these games, it may help to clone a simple, stochastic behavior that succeeds more on average. Those behaviors are implemented here as scripts.
